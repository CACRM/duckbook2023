  <li class="rvps7"><span class="rvts26">The nondeductible amount on property tax bills is divided equally between the two payments. &nbsp;So for example, if the taxpayer paid only one of the two tax bills during the tax year, divide the nondeductible amount by two, and subtract from the payment amount, to get the amount to enter on Schedule A. &nbsp;Or, if three bills were paid during the tax year (payment #2 from the prior bill plus both halves of the current bill), there will be three halves of nondeductible payments to subtract from the total of the three payments.</span></li>

  <li class="rvps7"><span class="rvts26">Document your findings in a TaxSlayer note, per page </span><span class="rvts106">8</span><span class="rvts26">. &nbsp;For example, a note called “PROPERTY TAX” might say “Nondeduct.: $215 Sewer charge for 2022-3 payment 2, $230 for 2023-4 payment 1; Vector disease control $8 each payment; PACE.” (This would help next year’s preparer know what’s non-deductible for </span><span class="rvts60">next </span><span class="rvts26">year’s spring payment, since the taxpayer may not bring the </span><span class="rvts60">previous</span><span class="rvts26"> bill.)</span></li>
